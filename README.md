## Project Title

**Multi-Signature Wallet**

A decentralized multi-signature wallet smart contract built on Stellar blockchain using Soroban SDK, requiring multiple approvals before executing transactions.

---

## Project Description

The Multi-Signature Wallet is a secure, decentralized smart contract solution that implements a multi-party approval system for blockchain transactions. This wallet requires multiple designated owners to approve a transaction before it can be executed, significantly enhancing security compared to traditional single-signature wallets.

### What It Does

The wallet operates on a simple yet powerful principle: no single individual can move funds alone. Instead, a predefined number of owners (signatories) must collectively approve each transaction. For example, in a 3-of-5 configuration, at least 3 out of 5 designated owners must approve before a transaction executes.

### Use Cases

- **Corporate Treasury Management**: Companies can secure their digital assets by requiring approval from multiple executives or board members
- **DAO Treasuries**: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations can manage community funds with transparent, democratic decision-making
- **Family Wealth Management**: Families can jointly manage inheritance or shared investments with built-in checks and balances
- **Partnership Funds**: Business partners can ensure mutual consent for all financial transactions
- **Escrow Services**: Trusted third parties can participate in multi-party agreements with built-in dispute resolution
- **High-Value Asset Protection**: Individuals can add extra security layers to protect significant holdings

### Why It Matters

In the crypto ecosystem, losing private keys or falling victim to a single point of compromise can result in irreversible asset loss. Multi-signature wallets distribute trust and risk across multiple parties, making unauthorized transactions virtually impossible without collusion. This smart contract brings enterprise-grade security to blockchain asset management while maintaining the decentralized, trustless nature of blockchain technology.

---

## Project Vision

Our vision extends beyond creating just another wallet—we aim to establish a new standard for secure, collaborative digital asset management in the Web3 era.

### Core Principles

**1. Security Without Compromise**
We believe that asset security should never rely on a single point of failure. By distributing control across multiple trusted parties, we eliminate the risk of unilateral bad actors while maintaining operational efficiency.

**2. Transparency & Trust**
Every transaction proposal, approval, and execution is permanently recorded on-chain, creating an immutable audit trail. This transparency builds trust among stakeholders and ensures accountability.

**3. Accessibility for All**
While multi-signature technology has traditionally been complex, we're committed to making it accessible to both technical and non-technical users through intuitive design and comprehensive documentation.

**4. Empowering Collaboration**
Financial decisions in organizations should reflect collective wisdom. Our wallet facilitates democratic decision-making while preventing deadlocks through configurable approval thresholds.

### Long-Term Goals

**Democratize Institutional-Grade Security**
Make multi-signature security accessible to individuals, small businesses, and communities—not just large enterprises and institutions.

**Build the Infrastructure for DAOs**
Provide the foundational treasury management tools that enable decentralized organizations to operate efficiently and transparently.

**Establish Industry Standards**
Contribute to the development of best practices and standards for multi-signature wallet implementations across blockchain ecosystems.

**Foster Financial Inclusion**
Enable groups in underbanked regions to collectively manage resources without relying on traditional banking infrastructure.

**Create an Ecosystem**
Develop a comprehensive suite of tools, integrations, and educational resources that make collaborative asset management the norm rather than the exception.

## Key Features

### 1. **Flexible Multi-Owner Configuration**

The wallet supports an unlimited number of owners, allowing organizations to scale their security model as they grow.

**Benefits:**
- Add as many signatories as needed for your security requirements
- Each owner maintains equal authority in the approval process
- Perfect for teams of any size, from small partnerships to large DAOs
- Owner addresses are permanently recorded on-chain for transparency

**Example Configuration:**
- 2-of-3 setup for small businesses
- 3-of-5 setup for medium-sized organizations
- 5-of-9 setup for large DAOs or foundations

### 2. **Customizable Approval Threshold**

Set the exact number of approvals required to execute transactions, balancing security needs with operational efficiency.

**Benefits:**
- Tailor security requirements to your specific risk profile
- Prevent both single points of failure and operational deadlocks
- Adjust the threshold to match organizational structure
- Ensures democratic decision-making for critical financial operations

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Higher thresholds = greater security but slower execution
- Lower thresholds = faster operations but increased risk
- Sweet spot typically between 50-70% of total owners

### 3. **Transparent Transaction Proposal System**

Any wallet owner can propose transactions, initiating the approval workflow in a democratic manner.

**How It Works:**
- Owner submits transaction with recipient address and amount
- System assigns unique transaction ID for tracking
- Proposal is immediately visible to all other owners
- Transaction enters pending state awaiting approvals

**Benefits:**
- Democratic initiation—no single "super admin"
- Complete transparency of all pending transactions
- Easy tracking with unique identifiers
- Prevents unauthorized or secret transaction attempts

### 4. **Secure Multi-Party Approval Mechanism**

Each owner can independently review and approve proposed transactions with built-in safeguards against fraud.

**Security Features:**
- Authentication required for every approval action
- One approval per owner per transaction (no double-voting)
- Real-time tracking of approval count
- Cannot approve already-executed transactions
- Only designated owners can approve

**User Experience:**
- Simple approve/reject interface
- View all pending approvals at a glance
- See which owners have already approved
- Get notified when action is required

### 5. **Threshold-Based Execution**

Transactions automatically become executable once they reach the required approval threshold, but still require explicit execution.

**Benefits:**
- Prevents premature transaction execution
- Provides final checkpoint before fund movement
- Allows for last-minute cancellation if needed (future feature)
- Creates clear audit trail of execution authorization

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- Cannot execute without sufficient approvals
- Cannot re-execute already-completed transactions
- Only wallet owners can trigger execution
- Execution action is permanently logged on-chain

### 6. **Complete On-Chain Transparency**

Every action—from proposal to execution—is recorded immutably on the Stellar blockchain.

**What Gets Recorded:**
- Transaction proposals with all details
- Every approval with owner identification
- Execution events with timestamps
- Complete chronological history

**Benefits:**
- Full audit trail for compliance and accountability
- Dispute resolution through verifiable history
- Regulatory compliance support
- Trust through transparency
- Historical analysis of spending patterns

### 7. **Owner Authentication & Authorization**

Robust identity verification ensures only legitimate owners can interact with the wallet.

**Security Layers:**
- Cryptographic signature verification for each action
- Owner whitelist validation
- Address-based access control
- Prevention of unauthorized access attempts

### 8. **Efficient Storage & State Management**

Optimized data structures minimize costs while maintaining complete functionality.

**Technical Excellence:**
- Instance storage for configuration and transaction data
- TTL management for long-term persistence (5000 ledgers)

## Technical Architecture

### Overview

The Multi-Signature Wallet is built on Soroban, Stellar's smart contract platform, leveraging Rust's safety guarantees and Soroban's efficient execution model.

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Structures

**WalletConfig**
```rust
pub struct WalletConfig {
    pub owners: Vec<Address>,           // List of wallet owner addresses
    pub required_approvals: u32,        // Minimum approvals needed
    pub total_transactions: u64,        // Counter for unique transaction IDs
}
```
- Stores fundamental wallet configuration
- Initialized once during wallet setup
- Persisted in instance storage

**Transaction**
```rust
pub struct Transaction {
    pub tx_id: u64,                     // Unique transaction identifier
    pub recipient: Address,             // Destination address
    pub amount: i128,                   // Amount to transfer (in stroops)
    pub approvals: u32,                 // Current number of approvals
    pub executed: bool,                 // Execution status flag
}
```
- Represents a proposed transaction
- Tracks approval progress
- Prevents double execution

**Storage Keys**
- `WALLET_CONFIG`: Stores wallet configuration
- `TX_COUNT`: Maintains transaction counter
- `TransactionBook`: Maps transaction IDs to Transaction structs
- `ApprovalBook`: Maps (tx_id, owner_address) to approval status

#### 2. Smart Contract Functions

**initialize()**
- **Purpose**: Set up new multi-sig wallet
- **Parameters**: owners (Vec<Address>), required_approvals (u32)
- **Validation**: 
  - At least one owner required
  - Required approvals ≤ total owners
  - Required approvals ≥ 1
- **Access**: Anyone (one-time initialization)

**propose_transaction()**
- **Purpose**: Create new transaction proposal
- **Parameters**: proposer (Address), recipient (Address), amount (i128)
- **Validation**:
  - Proposer must be an owner
  - Authentication required
- **Returns**: Transaction ID (u64)
- **Access**: Wallet owners only

**approve_transaction()**
- **Purpose**: Record owner's approval
- **Parameters**: approver (Address), tx_id (u64)
- **Validation**:

OWNER3=$(soroban keys address owner3)

# Initialize wallet (2-of-3 configuration)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner1 \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --owners "[\"$OWNER1\", \"$OWNER2\", \"$OWNER3\"]" \
  --required_approvals 2
```

### Verification

```bash
# Verify deployment
soroban contract info --id $CONTRACT_ID --network testnet
```

---

## Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Owner proposes** a transaction
2. **Other owners approve** the transaction
3. **Once threshold met**, any owner can execute

### Detailed Examples

#### Example 1: Complete Transaction Flow

```bash
# Step 1: Propose a transaction (Owner 1)
TX_ID=$(soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner1 \
  --network testnet \
  -- propose_transaction \
  --proposer $OWNER1 \
  --recipient GCEXAMPLE... \
  --amount 10000000)

echo "Transaction ID: $TX_ID"

# Step 2: Approve transaction (Owner 2)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner2 \
  --network testnet \
  -- approve_transaction \
  --approver $OWNER2 \
  --tx_id $TX_ID

# Step 3: Execute transaction (any owner)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner1 \
  --network testnet \
  -- execute_transaction \
  --executor $OWNER1 \
  --tx_id $TX_ID
```

#### Example 2: Multiple Approvals

```bash
# For a 3-of-5 wallet, get three approvals:

# Approval 1
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner2 \
  --network testnet \
  -- approve_transaction \
  --approver $OWNER2 \
  --tx_id 1

# Approval 2
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner3 \
  --network testnet \
  -- approve_transaction \
  --approver $OWNER3 \
  --tx_id 1

# Approval 3
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner4 \
  --network testnet \
  -- approve_transaction \
  --approver $OWNER4 \
  --tx_id 1

# Now execute
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner1 \
  --network testnet \
  -- execute_transaction \
  --executor $OWNER1 \
  --tx_id 1
```

#### Example 3: Handling Errors

```bash
# Attempting duplicate approval (will fail)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner2 \
  --network testnet \
  -- approve_transaction \
  --approver $OWNER2 \
  --tx_id 1
# Error: "Owner has already approved this transaction"

# Attempting execution without enough approvals (will fail)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner1 \
  --network testnet \
  -- execute_transaction \
  --executor $OWNER1 \
  --tx_id 2
# Error: "Not enough approvals to execute transaction"

# Non-owner attempting to approve (will fail)
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source attacker \
  --network testnet \
  -- approve_transaction \
  --approver $ATTACKER \
  --tx_id 1
# Error: "Only owners can approve transactions"
```

### Best Practices

**Transaction Management:**
- Always verify recipient addresses before proposing
- Document the purpose of each transaction
- Use descriptive amounts (include decimals correctly)
- Track transaction IDs systematically

**Approval Process:**
- Review transaction details before approving
- Coordinate with other owners via off-chain communication
- Don't rush the approval process
- Verify you're approving the correct transaction ID

**Security:**
- Never share private keys
- Use hardware wallets for owner accounts
- Implement multi-factor authentication for key access
- Regular security audits of owner accounts

**Operational:**
- Maintain a backup list of all owner addresses
- Document the approval threshold clearly
- Establish clear communication channels
- Create standard operating procedures

---

## Security Considerations

### Critical Security Practices

#### 1. Owner Account Security

**Private Key Management:**
- Store private keys in hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- Never store keys in plain text
- Use encrypted key storage solutions
- Implement key rotation policies

**Access Control:**
- Use separate devices for each owner
- Enable two-factor authentication everywhere possible
- Limit network exposure of signing devices
- Regular security audits of owner devices

#### 2. Contract Configuration

**Initialization:**
- Verify all owner addresses before initialization
- Double-check approval threshold logic
- Cannot be changed after initialization (until upgrade feature)
- Test on testnet extensively before mainnet

**Threshold Selection:**
- Balance security vs. operational efficiency
- Consider: N = total owners, K = required approvals
- Recommended: K ≥ ⌈N/2⌉ (majority)
- For high security: K ≥ ⌈2N/3⌉ (supermajority)
- Avoid: K = N (creates single point of failure if one owner unavailable)

#### 3. Transaction Verification

**Before Proposing:**
- Triple-check recipient address
- Verify amount (consider decimal places)
- Ensure sufficient wallet balance
- Document transaction purpose

**Before Approving:**
- Verify transaction details independently
- Confirm with proposer via separate channel
- Check for suspicious patterns
- Review transaction history

**Before Executing:**
- Final verification of all details
- Confirm sufficient approvals received
- Check for any last-minute concerns
- Ensure recipient is ready to receive

#### 4. Operational Security

**Communication:**
- Use encrypted channels for coordination
- Verify identity of other owners
- Establish code words for emergencies
- Document all major decisions

**Monitoring:**
- Regular audit of transaction history
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
- Track approval patterns
- Alert on unusual activity

**Incident Response:**
- Prepare emergency procedures
- Know how to freeze operations (future feature)
- Maintain contact with all owners
- Document incident response plan

### Common Attack Vectors & Mitigations

#### 1. Social Engineering

**Attack:** Attacker impersonates owner to trick others into approving malicious transaction.

**Mitigations:**
- Verify owner identity through multiple channels
- Establish verification protocols
- Never rush approval process
- Regular security awareness training

#### 2. Compromised Owner Account

**Attack:** Attacker gains access to one owner's private key.

**Mitigations:**
- Threshold > 1 prevents single-key compromise
- Quick response: propose owner rotation (future feature)
- Monitor for unusual activity from compromised account
- Hardware wallet usage

#### 3. Phishing Attacks

**Attack:** Fake website or contract ID tricks owners into interacting with malicious contract.

**Mitigations:**
- Always verify contract ID
- Bookmark official interfaces
- Use contract verification tools
- Education on phishing tactics

#### 4. Front-Running

**Attack:** Attacker observes pending transaction and submits competing transaction with higher gas.

**Mitigations:**
- Less relevant on Stellar (deterministic fees)
- Time-locks for sensitive transactions (future feature)
- Private mempools (if available)

#### 5. Denial of Service

**Attack:** Malicious owner refuses to approve legitimate transactions.

**Mitigations:**
- Careful selection of trusted owners
- Threshold < N ensures no single veto power
- Owner removal mechanism (future feature)
- Regular review of owner participation

### Audit & Compliance

**Pre-Deployment:**
- Professional smart contract audit recommended
- Formal verification of critical logic
- Extensive testnet testing
- Peer review of code

**Post-Deployment:**
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing
- Code review of any upgrades
- Community bug bounty program

**Compliance:**
- Understand local regulations
- KYC/AML considerations for institutional use
- Transaction record keeping
- Regulatory reporting as required

### Emergency Procedures

**If Owner Key Compromised:**
1. Immediately notify all other owners
2. Do not approve any pending transactions
3. Monitor wallet for unauthorized proposals
4. Prepare for owner rotation (when feature available)

**If Vulnerability Discovered:**
1. Assess severity and impact
2. Notify all owners immediately
3. Pause operations if necessary
4. Contact security professionals
5. Plan upgrade or migration

**If Funds Stolen:**
1. Document all evidence
2. Contact Stellar validators (if recent)
3. Report to relevant authorities
4. Community notification
5. Post-mortem analysis

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### General Questions

**Q: What is a multi-signature wallet?**

A: A multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet requires multiple parties to approve a transaction before it can be executed. Instead of a single private key controlling funds, multiple designated owners must collectively sign off on each transaction.

**Q: Why should I use a multi-sig wallet?**

A: Multi-sig wallets provide enhanced security by:
- Eliminating single points of failure
- Preventing unauthorized access even if one key is compromised
- Enabling democratic decision-making for shared funds
- Creating accountability through required approvals
- Providing an audit trail of all transactions

**Q: Who should use this wallet?**

A: Ideal for:
- Companies managing corporate treasuries
- DAOs handling community funds
- Partnerships requiring mutual consent
- Families managing shared wealth
- High-net-worth individuals seeking extra security
- Escrow services and trustless agreements

### Technical Questions

**Q: What blockchain is this built on?**

A: This smart contract is built on Stellar using the Soroban smart contract platform. Stellar offers fast, low-cost transactions with strong security guarantees.

**Q: Can I use this on mainnet?**

A: Yes, but we strongly recommend:
- Thorough testing on testnet first
- Professional security audit
- Starting with small amounts
- Understanding all risks involved

**Q: What are the gas fees?**

A: Stellar has very low and predictable fees (typically fractions of a cent). Exact costs depend on:
- Network congestion (usually minimal)
- Transaction complexity
- Storage requirements

**Q: Can the contract be upgraded?**

A: The current version is immutable once deployed. Future versions may include upgrade mechanisms. For now, migration to a new contract would be required for major changes.

**Q: Is the code audited?**

A: Community audits are ongoing. For production use with significant funds, we recommend commissioning a professional security audit from a reputable firm.

### Security Questions

**Q: What happens if I lose one owner's private key?**

A: As long as you have enough remaining owners to meet the approval threshold, the wallet remains functional. For example, in a 2-of-3 wallet, losing one key still allows the other two owners to operate the wallet.

**Q: Can funds be recovered if all keys are lost?**

A: No. Like all blockchain systems, if all private keys are lost, funds cannot be recovered. This is why proper key management and backup procedures are critical.

**Q: What if an owner's key is compromised?**

A: The multi-sig design means a single compromised key cannot move funds alone. Other owners can refuse to approve malicious transactions. Future versions will include owner rotation features to remove compromised owners.

**Q: Is this wallet safe from hacks?**

A: While the multi-sig design significantly improves security, no system is 100% hack-proof. Best practices include:
- Using hardware wallets for all owner keys
- Following security guidelines in this README
- Regular security audits
- Staying informed about vulnerabilities

### Usage Questions

**Q: How do I set up the wallet?**

A: Follow the Installation & Setup section of this README. You'll need to:
1. Deploy the smart contract
2. Initialize with owner addresses and approval threshold
3. Distribute access to owners

**Q: Can I add or remove owners after initialization?**

A: Not in the current version. This feature is planned for future releases. For now, you would need to deploy a new wallet and migrate funds.

**Q: What happens if owners disagree on a transaction?**

A: If insufficient owners approve, the transaction simply won't execute. It will remain in pending state. Consider establishing clear governance procedures for resolving disputes.

**Q: How long do transactions take?**

A: Once approved, execution is near-instant (5-6 seconds on Stellar). The approval process depends on how quickly owners respond, which could be minutes, hours, or days depending on your coordination.

**Q: Can I cancel a transaction after proposing it?**

A: Not in the current version. Transaction cancellation is a planned feature. For now, simply don't approve or execute transactions you wish to cancel.

### Cost & Fees Questions

**Q: How much does it cost to deploy?**

A: Deployment costs include:
- Gas fees for deployment (minimal on Stellar)
- Initialization transaction fee
- Storage rent for contract data (extended TTL)
Total: Usually less than $1 USD equivalent

**Q: Are there ongoing costs?**

A: Storage TTL must be extended periodically. The contract automatically extends TTL on each operation, so as long as the wallet is actively used, storage remains live. Inactive wallets may need manual TTL extension.

**Q: How do fees compare to traditional banking?**

A: Blockchain fees are typically 99%+ lower than traditional wire transfers or international payments, with faster settlement and 24/7 availability.

### Compatibility Questions

**Q: Can I use this with hardware wallets?**

A: Yes! Hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor can be used to sign transactions. This is highly recommended for security.

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**

A: Not yet. Mobile apps are planned for Phase 4 of the roadmap. Currently, use the Soroban CLI or web interfaces.

**Q: Can I integrate this with my existing application?**

A: Yes, through the Soroban RPC interface. Future versions will include REST APIs for easier integration.

**Q: Does this work with other Stellar assets?**

A: The current version is designed for XLM. Multi-asset support is planned for Phase 3 of the roadmap.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Wallet not initialized" error

**Symptoms:** Getting panic errors when trying to interact with contract

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify contract is initialized
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_wallet_config

# If not initialized, run initialization
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source owner1 \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --owners '["<addr1>", "<addr2>"]' \
  --required_approvals 2
```

#### Issue: "Only owners can approve transactions"

**Symptoms:** Error when trying to approve or propose

**Cause:** The address you're using is not in the owners list

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify you're using the correct identity
soroban keys address <your-identity>

# Check against the owners list from initialization
# Make sure the address matches exactly
```

#### Issue: "Owner has already approved this transaction"

**Symptoms:** Cannot approve transaction you've already approved

**Cause:** Duplicate approval attempt

**Solution:**
- This is expected behavior (prevents double-voting)
- Wait for other owners to approve
- Once threshold is met, execute the transaction

#### Issue: "Not enough approvals to execute transaction"

**Symptoms:** Execution fails even though you think you have enough approvals

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check transaction details
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --network testnet \
  -- get_transaction \
  --tx_id <transaction-id>

# Verify approvals count meets required_approvals threshold
# Get additional owner approvals if needed
```

#### Issue: "Transaction not found"

**Symptoms:** Error when trying to interact with transaction

**Causes:**
- Transaction ID doesn't exist
- Typo in transaction ID
- Transaction was created on different contract

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify the transaction ID
# Check which contract you're interacting with
# Use correct transaction counter

# List recent transactions (if helper function added)
```

#### Issue: Build errors

**Symptoms:** `cargo build` fails

**Common Solutions:**
```bash
# Update Rust
rustup update

# Clean and rebuild
cargo clean
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Check Soroban SDK version
cargo update soroban-sdk

# Verify wasm32 target is installed
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

#### Issue: Deployment fails

**Symptoms:** Contract deployment returns error

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify you have testnet XLM
soroban keys address deployer
# Fund via friendbot

# Check network configuration
soroban network ls

# Verify WASM file exists
ls -lh target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/*.wasm

# Try with explicit source
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm <path-to-wasm> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
```

#### Issue: Authentication failures

**Symptoms:** "Authentication required" errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ensure you're using --source parameter
soroban contract invoke \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --source <owner-identity> \  # Don't forget this!
  --network testnet \
  -- approve_transaction ...

# Verify the identity exists
soroban keys ls

# Check you have the correct network
soroban network ls
```

#### Issue: Storage TTL expired

**Symptoms:** Contract data not found, state seems lost

**Solution:**
```bash
# Extend TTL manually
soroban contract extend \
  --id $CONTRACT_ID \
  --ledgers-to-extend 100000 \
  --source owner1 \
  --network testnet

# The contract auto-extends on operations,
# but inactive contracts may need manual extension
```
